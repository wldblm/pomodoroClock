# pomodoroClock

Hello everyone.
Motivation is not here today so I'm gonna try my best.
I'm doing a pomodoro clock I think you knew already by the title...
It's 20:35 I stop at 22:00.

[update]
It's 23:17.
I haven't respect my delay because at 22:00 I didn't have any result and I didn't wanted to quit.
It was hard. 
Like really. 
I had forgotten how hard coding can be. 
And truth is, this project is really really easy I'm just so bad. 
I hope I will get better with the next projects.
I was so desperate at some point I told myself that I was just not good enough to be a developer.
Finally I did it. 
It's not perfect.
The code is probably shitty.
It's slow and full of bugs.
It's not optimized.
But it works, it fucking works.
(Except for the reset button)
Maybe I'll do it an other day but to be honest I'm tired of this project.
I'm gonna sleep right now.
Have a good night see you next time.
